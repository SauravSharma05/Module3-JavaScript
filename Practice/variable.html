    <h1>what is Variable</h1>
    <pre>
        1. var
        - we can re-declare and re-assign
        eg : 
                var a = 10;         // intialization and declaration
                a = "hello";        // re-declare and re-assigning

        ----------

        2. Let 
        - we can re-assign but can't re-declared
        eg  : 
                let a = 20;     // intialization, declaration & assigning
                let a = 30;     // no re-declare allowed

                a = 40;         // re-assign is possible

        ---------

        3. Const
        - we cannot do both re-assign and re-declare
        - it's a constant value which cannot be change at anytime
        eg : 
                const a = 10;
                const a = 20;   // cannot do here
